  <h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to Parkgrove Counselling. There are many reasons why you may be considering counselling. Are you feeling unhappy, hurt, confused or lacking in self-confidence? Perhaps you feel that you are going around in circles trying to find answers to a personal dilemma? Are you struggling to understand your feelings and emotions, or having difficulties relating to those around you? Is there something troubling you from your past or in your present? It can be daunting to take the first step into counselling but you’re almost there.</p>
<h1 id="what-i-offer">What I offer</h1>
<p>As a person-centred therapist, I offer a safe and confidential space where you can talk about the issues that are affecting you. With empathy and without judgement, I will help you explore your ways of thinking and being, and support you to find ways to live your life in a way that feels right for you. Rather than giving you answers or advice, I will help you shine a light on repeating patterns of behaviour or thinking that may be holding you back, helping you to find your own direction and a greater sense of inner peace. Normally we would meet on a weekly or fortnightly basis. The normal duration of a session is 50 minutes.</p>

<h1 id="practice-description">Practice Description</h1>
<p>I offer most of my sessions online at present but understand that online therapy is not for everyone.  There are also some issues that are more appropriately addressed in face-to-face sessions.   I have availability for face-to-face sessions on Tuesday afternoons/early evenings at The Wellbeing Rooms, 5A Kirk Road, Bearsden, G61 3RG.  Please contact me, by email or phone, to discuss availability for both online and face-to-face sessions.</p>
<p>You can find further details about the Wellbeing Rooms, Bearsden on their website: <a href="https://www.thewellbeingrooms.org.uk/">The Wellbeing Rooms (Scotland) LLP</a>.</p>
<h1 id="fees--privacy">Fees &amp; Privacy</h1>
<p>Face-to-face session - £60 (50 mins).</p>
<p>Online video session via Zoom - £50 (50 mins).</p>
<p>Please note the difference in fee is due to the cost of the room hire.</p>
<p>Concession rates are available.</p>
<p>For face-to-face sessions, payments can be paid in cash and taken at the end of each session. Payments can also be made via bank transfer prior to sessions. Receipts are available upon request.
For video sessions payments should be made in advance by bank transfer.</p>
<p>I am happy to offer an initial 30-minute free session to establish if we feel we can work well together.</p>
<p>I take confidentiality and privacy very seriously. I collect, store and process personal data in line with GDPR and am registered with the Information Commissioner’s Office.</p>
<h1 id="contact">Contact</h1>
<p>I can be contacted by email or telephone. If I am not available, please leave a short message and I will get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you are distressed and need urgent support, please call Samaritans on 116 123 or NHS 111.</p>
